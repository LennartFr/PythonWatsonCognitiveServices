## Synopsis

This repo wraps a few Python apps around the Watson Tone Analyzer service on Bluemix: https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/tone-analyzer.html

The interface between Python and the Watson Tone Analyzer is the Python SDK https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/python-sdk in the  Watson Developer Cloud: https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud 

## The steps to create the Python apps

### The first step is to sign up for the IBM Bluemix Cloud. 
For that you need to go to https://bluemix.net.
The process is quite simple, as shown in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUPwdfL8_oU

### The second step is to launch the Watson Tone Analyzer service.
It is hosted on the IBM Bluemix Cloud https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/tone-analyzer
Launching it is as simple as going to the Bluemix Catalog, search for the Tone Analyzer service and clicking on the Create Button on this link: https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/tone-analyzer?taxonomyNavigation=apps

The service will quickly be up and runing 

### The third step is to learn about the Watson Tone Analyzer service and its RESTful API.
